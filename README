FloreantPOS, a free open source Point of Sale system originally developed by OROCUBE LLC.  They now focus on their proprietary software and have not updated the open source version in a few years.  See their website (http://floreant.org and https://pos.orocube.com) for documentation and other info about floreantpos.  

This was cloned from sourceforge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/floreantpos/) at svn revision / release level 1897, the last update to the open source software.  A git repo was initialized to facilitate ongoing source code changes.

Updated all *.jar files to most current release that did not cause any errors / identifiable problems.  A few minor source coding changes to fix updated jar errors.
