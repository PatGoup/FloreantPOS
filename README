FloreantPOS

This was cloned from sourceforge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/floreantpos/) at svn revision / release level 1897.  Then created a git repo.

Updated all *.jar files to most current release that did not cause any errors.  A few minor source coding changes to fix updated jar errors.

This was tested on / with the following systems / software:
    linux debian buster 64 bit (my primary system)
    openjdk 11.0.9.1 2020-11-04
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.9.1+1-post-Debian-1deb10u2)

    Apache Maven 3.6.0
    Database MySQL / MariaDB version 10.3.27 

    Minimal testing on windows as I don't normally run windows computers.
